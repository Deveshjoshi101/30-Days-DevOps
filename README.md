- Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `repo-name` with the name of the repository.
- This will create a local copy of the repository where you can make your changes.

#### 3. **Create a New Branch**

- It's best practice to create a new branch for your work. Name it after the feature or task you are working on:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b your-branch-name
  ```
- Replace `your-branch-name` with a descriptive name (e.g., `day-1-tasks`, `add-docker-exercises`).

#### 4. **Create Your Folder**

- Inside the repository, create a new folder with your GitHub username to keep your contributions organized:
  ```bash
  mkdir your-github-username
  ```
- Complete all the day-wise tasks within your folder. You can structure it by creating subfolders for each week or day. For example:

```
your-github-username/
├── Week1/
│   ├── Day1/
│   ├── Day2/
│   └── ...
└── Week2/
    ├── Day8/
    └── ...
```

#### 5. **Make Your Changes**

- Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them with a meaningful message:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Completed Day X tasks by [Your Name]"
  ```
- Replace `[Your Name]` with your actual name.

#### 7. **Push to Your Fork**

- Push your changes to your forked repository:
  ```bash
  git push origin your-branch-name
  ```
- This will update your GitHub fork with the changes you made locally.

#### 8. **Create an Issue (Optional)**

- If you found a bug, have a suggestion, or want to propose a new feature, create an issue before making your changes. This helps in tracking and discussing the changes.
- Go to the "Issues" tab in the main repository and click on "New Issue." Provide a detailed description of the issue or suggestion.

#### 9. **Open a Pull Request**

- Head to the original repository you forked from. Click on the "Pull Requests" tab and then "New Pull Request."
- Select the branch you created from your forked repository as the source and the main branch of the original repository as the destination.
- Provide a detailed description of the changes you made, why they are necessary, and any additional context. Make sure to mention the issue number (if applicable) that this pull request addresses (e.g., "Fixes #12").

#### 10. **Wait for Review**

- The repository maintainers will review your pull request. Be prepared to answer questions or make requested changes.
- Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main repository!

#### 11. **Celebrate Your Contribution!** 🎉
